# Clustering Analysis Steps

This document provides a detailed explanation of the clustering analysis steps performed on the dataset, including identifying the optimal number of clusters, training a K-Means model, and visualizing the clusters.

## Step 1: Upload the Training and Testing Datasets

**What We Did:**  
We uploaded the preprocessed training and testing datasets into the Google Colab environment.

**Why:**  
Uploading the preprocessed datasets allows us to continue our analysis in Google Colab, ensuring we are working with the correct and clean version of the data.

```python
from google.colab import files
import pandas as pd

# Upload the training and testing datasets
uploaded = files.upload()

# Load the training and testing datasets
X_train_scaled = pd.read_csv('X_train_scaled.csv')
X_test_scaled = pd.read_csv('X_test_scaled.csv')
y_train = pd.read_csv('y_train.csv')
y_test = pd.read_csv('y_test.csv')

# Display the first few rows of the training data
X_train_scaled.head()
```

## Step 2: Identify the Optimal Number of Clusters Using the Elbow Method

**What We Did:**  
We used the Elbow Method to identify the optimal number of clusters by plotting the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) against the number of clusters.

**Why:**  
The Elbow Method helps in determining the optimal number of clusters for K-Means clustering by identifying a point where the rate of decrease in WCSS slows down, forming an 'elbow.' This point indicates a balance between the number of clusters and the model's complexity.

```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Calculate WCSS for different number of clusters
wcss = []
for i in range(1, 11):
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=i, init='k-means++', max_iter=300, n_init=10, random_state=42)
    kmeans.fit(X_train_scaled)
    wcss.append(kmeans.inertia_)

# Plot the Elbow graph
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(range(1, 11), wcss, marker='o', linestyle='--')
plt.title('Elbow Method for Optimal Number of Clusters')
plt.xlabel('Number of Clusters')
plt.ylabel('WCSS')
plt.show()
```

## Step 3: Train the K-Means Clustering Model

**What We Did:**  
We trained a K-Means clustering model on the training dataset using the optimal number of clusters identified by the Elbow Method.

**Why:**  
Training the K-Means model allows us to group similar data points into clusters, enabling us to identify distinct customer segments based on key features.

```python
# Assuming the optimal number of clusters is 3 based on the Elbow method (adjust if different)
optimal_clusters = 3

# Train the K-Means model
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=optimal_clusters, init='k-means++', max_iter=300, n_init=10, random_state=42)
kmeans.fit(X_train_scaled)

# Predict the clusters for the training data
clusters = kmeans.predict(X_train_scaled)

# Add the cluster labels to the training data
X_train_scaled['Cluster'] = clusters

# Display the first few rows of the data with cluster labels
X_train_scaled.head()
```

## Step 4: Visualize the Clusters Using PCA

**What We Did:**  
We reduced the dimensionality of the dataset using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and visualized the clusters in a 2D plot.

**Why:**  
Visualizing the clusters helps in interpreting the results and understanding how the data points are grouped. PCA reduces the complexity of the data while retaining most of the variation, making it easier to visualize.

```python
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA

# Reduce the dimensionality of the data to 2 components using PCA
pca = PCA(n_components=2)
pca_components = pca.fit_transform(X_train_scaled.drop('Cluster', axis=1))

# Plot the clusters
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.scatter(pca_components[:, 0], pca_components[:, 1], c=X_train_scaled['Cluster'], cmap='viridis', marker='o')
plt.title('Clusters Visualization')
plt.xlabel('PCA Component 1')
plt.ylabel('PCA Component 2')
plt.colorbar(label='Cluster')
plt.show()
```

## Step 5: Save the Trained K-Means Model and Results

**What We Did:**  
We saved the trained K-Means model and the cluster labels to files, allowing us to download and use them for further analysis or deployment.

**Why:**  
Saving the model and cluster results ensures that the work done can be reused without needing to retrain the model. This step is crucial for deploying the model or sharing the results with others.

```python
import joblib

# Save the trained K-Means model
joblib.dump(kmeans, 'kmeans_model.pkl')

# Save the cluster labels with the training data
X_train_scaled.to_csv('train_with_clusters.csv', index=False)

# Save the cluster centers for interpretation
cluster_centers = pd.DataFrame(kmeans.cluster_centers_, columns=X_train_scaled.columns[:-1])
cluster_centers.to_csv('cluster_centers.csv', index=False)

# Download the model and the cluster data
files.download('kmeans_model.pkl')
files.download('train_with_clusters.csv')
files.download('cluster_centers.csv')
```
